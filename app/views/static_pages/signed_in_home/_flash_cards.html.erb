      <p>Flash cards are another great way to test your mastery of a subject. </p>
      <p>You can create decks and play them. You can assign difficulty levels 
          to individual cards and then filter by a particular level when playing 
          them. 
      </p>
      <p> You can even save your history and when you replay the deck, only
          play ones you missed last time or that you've ever missed in the past. 
      </p>
      <p>Awesome! <small>(as the kids say these days)</small> </p>
